# Project Requirements Document: SolarCalc PH — Solar ROI & Battery Calculator

> **Version:** 1.5.0
> **Date:** 2026-03-16
> **Source:** `250915 SOLAR ROI .xlsx` spreadsheet + `Solar_ROI_App_PRD_v2.md`
> **Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**SolarCalc PH** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows Philippine homeowners, business owners, and solar sales reps to calculate solar photovoltaic and battery storage return-on-investment in real time — entirely offline, with zero backend dependencies.

**Tagline:** *"Know your payback before you pay."*

The app digitizes and extends the logic from the "250915 SOLAR ROI" spreadsheet, which models three scenarios (Solar Only, Battery Only, Combined) with configurable inputs for electricity rates, operating schedules, system sizing, battery storage, and loan financing.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

The existing Excel spreadsheet (`250915 SOLAR ROI .xlsx`) provides a powerful ROI model but has significant limitations:

- **Not mobile-friendly** — sales reps can't use it on-site with clients
- **No offline capability** — requires Excel or a compatible app
- **No guided onboarding** — users must understand which cells to edit ("ONLY ENCODE IN THE BLUE")
- **No input validation** — users can enter invalid data without warning
- **No contextual help** — tooltips and explanations are absent
- **Single-scenario view** — the spreadsheet calculates Solar, Battery, and Combined, but the UX is not intuitive
- **No sun hours reference** — users don't know their location's peak sun hours
- **No cost projection visibility** — users can't see their current annual electricity costs

## 5. Section-by-Section Explanation

Each of the four sections builds on the previous one. Together they answer: **"What am I paying now, what will solar cost, do I need a battery, and how do I finance it?"**

---

### 5.1 Section 1 — Status Quo: "How much electricity are you consuming and paying for?"

**Purpose:** Establish the user's current electricity cost baseline. This is the number that solar savings are measured against — if you don't know what you're paying now, you can't calculate what you'll save.

**The core question:** *How many kWh do you consume, and at what price?*

#### User Story
A homeowner or business owner opens the app. They may know their electricity rate, or they may only have a Meralco bill total. The Status Quo section supports both paths:

**Path A — "I know my consumption":**
1. Enter **electricity rate** (₱/kWh) — the blended rate from their bill
2. Enter **average daily consumption** (kWh/day) — how much power they use per day
3. Enter **operating schedule** — how many weeks/year and days/week
4. The app computes: daily kWh → **annual kWh** → **annual cost** → **monthly cost**

**Path B — "I just know my bill total":**
1. Enter **electricity rate** (₱/kWh)
2. Enter **annual bill** (₱) directly — the app reverse-calculates daily consumption

#### Electricity Rate Benchmarks

| Type | Typical Blended Rate | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| **Residential** (Meralco) | ₱11–₱13/kWh | Higher per-kWh due to lifeline subsidies, universal charge |
| **Commercial** (Meralco) | ₱9–₱11/kWh | Lower per-kWh but higher absolute bills |
| **Industrial** | ₱7–₱9/kWh | Bulk rates, demand charges separate |
| **Provincial utilities** | ₱8–₱15/kWh | Varies widely by electric cooperative |

> **How to calculate your blended rate:** Total Bill Amount ÷ Total kWh Consumed. Do NOT use just the "Generation Charge" line — that's only one component. The blended rate includes transmission, distribution, metering, universal charges, and VAT.

**Default:** ₱15/kWh (commercial baseline; residential rates typically ₱15–₱20/kWh).

#### Consumption Chain

The key insight is that the user enters **daily** consumption, and the app builds up to annual:

```
Daily Consumption (kWh/day)
  × Operating Days/Year (weeks × days/week)
  = Annual Consumption (kWh/year)           ← new computed field
  × Electricity Rate (₱/kWh)
  = Annual Cost (₱/year)
  ÷ 12
  = Monthly Cost (₱/month)
```

**Example — Small residential:**
```
30 kWh/day × 364 days = 10,920 kWh/year × ₱12/kWh = ₱131,040/year = ₱10,920/month
```

**Example — Medium commercial:**
```
500 kWh/day × 300 days = 150,000 kWh/year × ₱10/kWh = ₱1,500,000/year = ₱125,000/month
```

**Example — Large commercial (from spreadsheet):**
```
1,200 kWh/day × 300 days = 360,000 kWh/year × ₱11/kWh = ₱3,960,000/year = ₱330,000/month
```

#### Annual Bill Override

If the user enters an `annualBill` value, it **overrides** the computed annual cost and the app **reverse-calculates** daily consumption:

```
dailyConsumption = annualBill / (electricityRate × operatingDaysPerYear)
annualConsumptionKWh = annualBill / electricityRate
```

A visual badge indicates the value is user-overwritten (not computed).

---

### 5.2 Section 2 — PhotoVoltaic System: "How big a solar system, and what will it cost?"

**Purpose:** Size the PV system and calculate its energy output and equipment cost. This is the "engine" — how many kilowatts of solar capacity, how many hours of effective sun, and what the panels will produce.

**The core question:** *How much solar energy will my system generate each day and year?*

#### Key Inputs
- **PV Capacity (kW)** — the "engine size" of the solar plant for direct daytime use. Rule of thumb: 1 kW needs ~10 m² of unshaded roof.
- **Peak Sun Hours/day** — effective full-power output hours (see Section 7 for PSH calculator). Philippine default: 4.0 hours.
- **Price per kW** — total installed cost per kilowatt of solar capacity. Suggested default: ₱80,000/kW residential, ₱50,000/kW commercial. Users can adjust based on actual quotes.
- **Misc Infrastructure** — roof waterproofing, structural reinforcement, rewiring, net-metering fees.

#### Generation & Savings Chain
```
(PV Capacity + PV for Battery) (kW) × Peak Sun Hours (hrs/day)
  = Daily Generation (kWh/day)               ← total output from ALL installed panels
  × Electricity Rate (₱/kWh)
  = Daily Savings (₱/day)                    ← shown in Section 2 results
  × Operating Days/Year
  = Annual Savings (₱/year)                  ← shown in Dashboard
```

> **Tooltip on Annual Savings KPI:** "Savings Per Day × Operating Weeks/Year × Operating Days/Week"

#### Cost Chain
```
(PV Capacity + PV for Battery) (kW) × Price per kW (₱/kW)
  = PV Equipment Cost (₱)                   ← ALL solar panels, including those charging the battery
  + Misc Infrastructure (₱)
  = Total PV CAPEX (₱)                      ← feeds into Dashboard Total CAPEX
```

> **Total CAPEX** in the Dashboard = Total PV CAPEX (Section 2) + Battery Cost (Section 3). The PV for Battery panels are included in PV Equipment Cost because they are purchased as part of the same installation. The CAPEX KPI card links back to Section 2.

---

### 5.3 Section 3 — Battery Storage: "Do I need batteries for nighttime power?"

**Purpose:** Calculate battery requirements for nighttime operation. Solar panels only produce during the day — if the user needs power at night (security, aircon, refrigeration), they need battery storage. This section also shows how much of the PV system must be **allocated** to charging the batteries, and whether that allocation is sufficient.

**The core question:** *How many kWh of battery do I need, how much solar do I allocate to charge it, and is that enough?*

#### Key Inputs
- **Battery Price per kWh** — unit cost for battery storage capacity. Suggested default: ₱30,000/kWh residential, ₱12,000/kWh commercial. Users can adjust based on actual quotes.
- **Battery Capacity (kWh)** — the size of the battery system you want to install. Can be entered manually or calculated from nighttime load needs.
- **PV for Battery (kW)** — how many kW of PV capacity the user dedicates to charging the battery. This is additional capacity on top of the Section 2 PV Capacity.
- **Nighttime kWh/Hr** — average power consumption per hour during nighttime (optional, for reference calculation). Note: This is measured in kW (kilowatts), which is equivalent to kWh/hr (kilowatt-hours per hour).
- **Nighttime Duration (hours)** — how many hours after sunset battery power is needed (optional, for reference calculation)

#### Battery Cost Chain
```
Battery Capacity (kWh) × Battery Price per kWh (₱/kWh)
  = Battery Cost (₱)
```

#### Battery Charge Percentage
```
PV for Battery (kW) × Peak Sun Hours (hrs/day)
  = Daily Charge Capacity (kWh)

Battery Charge % = (Daily Charge Capacity / Battery Capacity kWh) × 100
```

This tells the user: **"Your allocated solar can charge {batteryChargePercent}% of the battery per day."**

- **100% or more** — fully charged every day (green indicator)
- **50–99%** — partially charged; battery won't last the full nighttime duration (yellow indicator)
- **Below 50%** — significantly under-allocated; consider adding more solar or reducing battery size (red indicator)

#### Extra PV Cost for Battery Charging
```
PV for Battery (kW) × Price per kW (₱/kW, from Section 2)
  = Extra PV Cost for Battery Charging (₱)
```

This cost is added to the **Total PV CAPEX** shown in Section 2 results.

#### Reference: Required Battery Calculation (Optional)
```
Nighttime kWh/Hr × Duration (hours)
  = Reference Required Battery (kWh)
```

This calculation provides a reference/suggestion for battery sizing but does not auto-populate the Battery Capacity field. Users can use this as guidance when deciding on their actual battery size.

> **Note:** Battery Capacity = 0 means "no battery needed." The Section 3 Results panel will show a friendly message: *"No battery configured — battery capacity is zero."*

---

### 5.4 Section 4 — Financing: "How do I pay for it?"

**Purpose:** Model loan financing for the solar investment. Many buyers finance 40–100% of the system cost. This section shows the true cost of borrowing.

**The core question:** *What's my monthly payment, and does solar still save me money after the loan payment?*

#### Key Inputs
- **Loan Principal (₱)** — how much of the total system cost is being financed
- **Annual Interest Rate (%)** — the bank's annual rate (Philippine typical: 8–12%)
- **Loan Term (months)** — repayment period (typical: 60 months = 5 years)

#### Financing Chain
```
Standard Annuity Formula:
  Monthly Payment = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
  where P = principal, r = monthly rate, n = months

Monthly Payment × Loan Term = Total Loan Cost
Total Loan Cost - Principal = Total Interest Paid

Monthly Savings (from solar) - Monthly Payment = Net Monthly Cash Flow
```

If loan principal is 0 or empty:
- **Section 4 Results panel is hidden entirely**
- A **"Cash purchase — no financing"** message displays instead of loan calculations
- No financing KPIs appear in the Results Dashboard

If loan principal > 0:
- Section 4 Results panel shows loan details (Monthly Payment, Total Loan Cost, Total Interest)
- Financing KPIs appear in the Results Dashboard

If the net monthly cash flow is positive, the solar system pays for itself even during the loan period. If negative, the user is paying more per month than they save until the loan is paid off.

---

### 5.5 The Narrative — Putting It All Together

After all four sections are filled in and the Dashboard KPIs are computed, the app generates a **plain-language narrative** that strings every number into a coherent story. The narrative presents the analysis as a Problem → Hypothesis → Evidence → Verdict flow that the user can read top-to-bottom or share with a decision-maker.

#### Structure

**Part 1 — The Problem: Your Current Electricity Costs**

> You are paying **₱{electricityRate}/kWh** for electricity. At **{dailyEnergyConsumptionKWh} kWh/day** over **{operatingDaysPerYear} operating days/year**, you consume **{annualConsumptionKWh} kWh/year**, costing you **₱{projectedAnnualCost}/year** (or **₱{projectedMonthlyCost}/month**).

If `annualBill` was entered as an override, note:
> *(Your actual annual bill of ₱{annualBill} was used instead of the projected cost.)*

**Part 2 — The Hypothesis: What If You Installed Solar?**

> A **{solarCapacityKW} kW PhotoVoltaic system** at **{peakSunHoursPerDay} peak sun hours/day** would generate **{dailyGenerationKWh} kWh/day**, saving you **₱{dailySavings}/day** on electricity.
>
> The PV equipment costs **₱{pvSystemCost}** plus **₱{miscInfraCosts}** in infrastructure, for a total PV investment of **₱{totalPVCapex}**.

**Part 3 — Battery Storage (if applicable)**

If `batteryCapacityKWh > 0`:

> You've configured **{batteryCapacityKWh} kWh** of battery storage, costing **₱{batteryCost}**.
>
> To charge these batteries, you've allocated **{pvForBatteryKW} kW** of solar capacity dedicated to battery charging — bringing your total PV to **{totalSolarKW} kW**. The extra panels add **₱{extraSolarCost}** to the system cost.
>
> With **{peakSunHoursPerDay} peak sun hours/day**, your allocated PV can generate **{dailyChargeCapacityKWh} kWh/day** for battery charging — that's **{batteryChargePercent}%** of your battery capacity charged per day.

If no battery needed:
> No battery storage configured — your facility operates with solar only during daylight hours.

**Part 4 — The Investment: Total CAPEX**

> Your total capital expenditure is **₱{totalCapex}**, covering the PV system (Section 2) and battery storage (Section 3).

**Part 5 — The Return: Savings & ROI**

> Over **{operatingDaysPerYear} operating days/year**, your daily savings of **₱{dailySavings}** add up to **₱{annualSavings}/year** in reduced electricity costs (or **₱{monthlySavings}/month**).
>
> This gives you a **Simple ROI of {simpleROI}%** — meaning you recover **{simpleROI}%** of your investment each year. The inverse of this tells us your **Payback Period: {paybackYears} years** — the time until the system has fully paid for itself.

**Part 6 — Financing (if applicable)**

If `loanPrincipal > 0`:

> If you finance **₱{loanPrincipal}** at **{annualInterestRate}%** over **{loanTermMonths} months**, your monthly payment is **₱{monthlyAmortization}**. Over the loan term, you'll pay **₱{totalLoanCost}** total, of which **₱{totalInterestPaid}** is interest.
>
> After deducting the loan payment from your monthly savings: **₱{monthlySavings} - ₱{monthlyAmortization} = ₱{netMonthlyCashFlow}/month** net cash flow.

If `netMonthlyCashFlow >= 0`:
> **The solar system pays for itself even during the loan period.**

If `netMonthlyCashFlow < 0`:
> **During the loan period, you pay ₱{abs(netMonthlyCashFlow)}/month more than you save.** After the loan is paid off in {paybackYears} years, you keep the full ₱{monthlySavings}/month as pure savings.

If no financing:
> **Cash purchase — no financing costs.** Your full monthly savings of ₱{monthlySavings} go straight to recovering your investment.

**Part 7 — The Verdict**

A one-line summary with conditional tone based on payback period and net monthly cash flow buffer. ROI % is shown as supporting data but does **not** drive the verdict — payback and cash flow are the primary decision factors.

**Verdict thresholds (evaluated top-to-bottom; first match wins):**

| Priority | Condition | Verdict |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | `paybackYears > 6` **OR** (`hasFinancing` AND `netMonthlyCashFlow < 0`) | 🔴 Red |
| 2 | `paybackYears > 4` **OR** (`hasFinancing` AND `netMonthlyCashFlow < 0.20 × monthlySavings`) | 🟡 Yellow |
| 3 | All other cases (payback ≤ 4 yrs, cash flow buffer ≥ 20% or no financing) | 🟢 Green |

**Threshold rationale:**
- **Red — payback > 6 years:** The investment takes too long to recover; opportunity cost and system degradation risk outweigh returns.
- **Red — negative cash flow:** When the monthly loan payment exceeds monthly savings, the system actively costs money each month during the loan period — a concrete financial loss.
- **Yellow — payback 4–6 years:** The investment is sound but slow; the user should evaluate whether capital could work harder elsewhere.
- **Yellow — cash flow buffer < 20%:** The loan payment consumes more than 80% of monthly savings, leaving a thin margin. A budget variance (rate change, consumption spike, maintenance cost) could easily push the user into negative cash flow.
- **Green:** Payback within 4 years and cash flow retains at least 20% of monthly savings as buffer — the investment is both fast-returning and financially comfortable during the loan period.

**Note on `hasFinancing`:** Cash flow conditions only apply when `loanPrincipal > 0`. For cash purchases, the cash flow buffer check is skipped (no loan payment to compare against).

**Verdict text by final level:**

- **Green:** "Strong investment. Your {solarCapacityKW} kW system pays for itself in {paybackYears} years ({simpleROI}% annual return). During the loan period, your monthly net cash flow is ₱{netMonthlyCashFlow} — a comfortable {cashFlowBufferPct}% buffer above your savings."
  *(If no financing: "Strong investment. Your {solarCapacityKW} kW system pays for itself in {paybackYears} years ({simpleROI}% annual return).")*

- **Yellow — payback 4–6 years:** "Moderate investment. Payback in {paybackYears} years at {simpleROI}% annual returns — consider optimizing system size or reducing costs to accelerate recovery."

- **Yellow — thin cash flow buffer (0–19% of savings):** "Caution: your loan payment (₱{monthlyAmortization}/month) consumes {loanShareOfSavingsPct}% of your monthly savings (₱{monthlySavings}), leaving only ₱{netMonthlyCashFlow}/month ({cashFlowBufferPct}%) as buffer. The system is self-funding, but with minimal margin — any increase in costs or decrease in savings could push you into deficit during the loan period."

- **Red — negative cash flow:** "Not recommended under current financing terms. Your monthly loan payment (₱{monthlyAmortization}) exceeds your monthly savings (₱{monthlySavings}) by ₱{abs(netMonthlyCashFlow)}/month — the system costs you money each month during the loan period. Consider a smaller loan principal, longer loan term, lower interest rate, or evaluate a cash purchase."

- **Red — payback > 6 years:** "Marginal investment at current assumptions. A {paybackYears}-year payback period is too long to justify the capital risk. Review your electricity rate, system sizing, or pricing — or consider a phased installation to reduce upfront CAPEX."

**Derived display fields for verdict text:**
- `cashFlowBufferPct` = `(netMonthlyCashFlow / monthlySavings) × 100` (only when `monthlySavings > 0`)
- `loanShareOfSavingsPct` = `(monthlyAmortization / monthlySavings) × 100` (only when `monthlySavings > 0`)

### 5.6 Quick Presets

Quick Presets allow users to load pre-configured scenarios with a single click. These presets serve as **benchmarks** — users can start from a realistic scenario and adjust to match their specific situation.

#### 🏠 Residential Preset — 5kW @ ₱80,000/kW

**Target User:** Homeowner with typical Meralco residential service

**Subtext:** 30 kWh/day • ₱20/kWh • Night: AC, fridge, fans (1.5kW)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Daily Consumption** | 30 kWh/day | Typical home with AC, refrigerator, appliances |
| **Operating Schedule** | 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year | Home occupied daily |
| **Electricity Rate** | ₱20/kWh | Meralco residential blended rate |
| **Solar System Size** | 5 kW | Typical residential rooftop installation |
| **Solar Price** | ₱80,000/kW | **The "Entry-Level" Reality** — includes residential overhead |
| **Battery Price** | ₱30,000/kWh | Consumer-grade LFP (wall-mounted units) |
| **Battery Capacity** | 12 kWh | 1.5 kW × 8 hours = 12 kWh for typical nighttime needs |
| **PV for Battery** | 3 kW | 12 kWh ÷ 4 peak sun hours = 3 kW needed to fully charge |
| **Nighttime kWh/Hr** | 1.5 kWh/hr | Aircon (0.75-1.5 kW) + Fridge (0.05-0.1 kW) + Fans/Routers (0.1 kW) |
| **Nighttime Duration** | 8 hours | 10pm - 6am typical usage |
| **Misc Costs** | ₱50,000 | Permits, inspection, small job overhead |
| **Loan Principal** | ₱250,000 | Partial financing (~50% of system cost) |
| **Interest Rate** | 8% | Typical personal/home improvement loan |

**The Residential "Entry Tax" — Why ₱80k/kW?**

Residential buyers face a **70–100% price premium** compared to commercial buyers due to:

1. **Soft Costs Barrier** — Permitting, engineering, and logistics costs are nearly the same for a small house as for a small warehouse. On a per-kW basis, this creates a steep "entry tax" for residential systems.

2. **Volume Barrier** — Small-scale buyers cannot access Tier 1 factory-direct pricing or volume logistics discounts. Residential buyers pay retail markup on every component.

3. **High Labor-to-Watt Ratio** — A 5kW residential system requires nearly the same crew and labor hours as a 20kW commercial system, but spread over fewer kW.

4. **Individual Permitting** — Each residential system requires customized structural assessment, individual net-metering applications, and bespoke mounting solutions.

5. **All-In Cost** — The ₱80k/kW rate includes the "Residential Overhead": labor, permitting, engineering, and installation complexity.

6. **Battery Inclusion** — This rate assumes a standard Hybrid LFP setup (5–10 kWh) to cover the 1.5 kW nighttime load.

**ROI Reality:** Expect 7–9 year payback due to higher per-kW costs, though this improves significantly if you can negotiate better pricing or qualify for incentives.

---

#### 🏢 Commercial Preset — 100kW @ ₱50,000/kW

**Target User:** Business with 100 office employees

**Subtext:** 100 kWh/day • ₱15/kWh • 100 employees • Night: 15kW

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Daily Consumption** | 100 kWh/day | 100 employees × 1 kWh/person/day (computers, AC, lighting, equipment) |
| **Operating Schedule** | 5 days/week, 52 weeks/year | Standard business operations |
| **Electricity Rate** | ₱15/kWh | Meralco commercial blended rate (lower than residential) |
| **Solar System Size** | 100 kW | Medium commercial rooftop or ground-mount installation |
| **Solar Price** | ₱50,000/kW | **The "Volume Advantage"** — sharp pricing territory |
| **Battery Price** | ₱12,000/kWh | Industrial LFP racks (48V or high voltage) — cheaper per kWh than residential wall units |
| **Battery Capacity** | 180 kWh | 15 kW × 12 hours = 180 kWh for nighttime operations |
| **PV for Battery** | 45 kW | 180 kWh ÷ 4 peak sun hours = 45 kW needed to fully charge |
| **Nighttime kWh/Hr** | 15 kWh/hr | Security lights (0.5 kW) + Servers/Network (1 kW) + Refrigeration (2 kW) + CCTV + Emergency lighting |
| **Nighttime Duration** | 12 hours | 6pm - 6am business closure |
| **Misc Costs** | ₱500,000 | Commercial permitting, engineering, net metering |
| **Loan Principal** | ₱2,500,000 | Partial financing (~50% of system cost) |
| **Interest Rate** | 10% | Typical commercial equipment financing |

**The Commercial "Volume Advantage" — Why ₱50k/kW?**

At 100kW+, the system enters **"Sharp Pricing" territory** with significant advantages:

1. **Economies of Scale** — Bulk panel purchasing, standardized mounting systems, and efficient crew deployment spread fixed costs over many kW.

2. **Procurement Power** — Ability to "bid out" multi-million PHP setups forces installers to work on thinner margins. Buyers can negotiate factory-direct or Tier 1 distributor pricing.

3. **Streamlined Logistics** — Single delivery, single crew, single permitting process for the entire system reduces per-kW overhead.

4. **Industrial-Grade Equipment** — Commercial systems use rack-mounted inverters and standardized BOS (balance of system) components that are cheaper per Watt than residential equivalents.

5. **Battery Scaling** — The ₱12k/kWh rate reflects industrial-grade LFP racks (48V or high voltage) which are dramatically cheaper per kWh than residential wall-mounted units. A 180 kWh commercial battery costs less than 6× a 5 kWh residential battery.

6. **ROI Acceleration** — The lower cost per kW (₱50k vs ₱80k) directly results in significantly faster ROI: **typically 3–4 years for commercial vs. 7–9 years for residential**.

**The Volume Threshold:** Most installers offer meaningful price breaks at 20kW, 50kW, and 100kW tiers. The 100kW preset represents the "sweet spot" where pricing becomes highly competitive.

### 6.3 Section Results Panels

Each section displays its own inline results panel below its inputs. These give the user immediate feedback within the section context before they scroll to the main dashboard.

#### Section 1 — Status Quo Results

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR CURRENT ELECTRICITY COSTS             │
│                                             │
│  Operating Days/Year      364 days          │
│  Annual Consumption       18,200 kWh/yr     │
│  Projected Annual Cost    ₱182,000.00 /yr   │
│  Projected Monthly Cost   ₱15,166.67 /mo    │
│                                             │
│  [Annual Bill: ₱_____ (optional override)]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Formulas:**
```
operatingDaysPerYear  = operatingWeeksPerYear × operatingDaysPerWeek
annualConsumptionKWh  = dailyEnergyConsumptionKWh × operatingDaysPerYear
projectedAnnualCost   = annualConsumptionKWh × electricityRate
projectedMonthlyCost  = projectedAnnualCost / 12
```

**Reverse Calculation:** When user enters `annualBill` without `dailyEnergyConsumptionKWh`, the system calculates backwards:
```
dailyEnergyConsumptionKWh = annualBill / (electricityRate × operatingDaysPerYear)
```

When `annualBill` is entered, it overrides `projectedAnnualCost` and `projectedMonthlyCost` is recalculated from the override. A visual indicator (badge or icon) shows the value is user-overwritten.

#### Section 2 — PhotoVoltaic System Results

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  PV Total Capacity        13.0 kW           │  ← NEW: shows total including battery PV
│  PV Equipment Cost        ₱300,000.00       │
│  Total PV CAPEX           ₱300,000.00       │
│  Daily Generation         40.0 kWh/day      │
│  Daily Savings            ₱400.00 /day      │
│  Annual Generation        14,600 kWh/yr     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Dashboard link:** Total PV CAPEX feeds into the Dashboard's **Total CAPEX** KPI. Total CAPEX = Total PV CAPEX (Section 2) + Battery Cost (Section 3). PV for Battery panels are already included in PV Equipment Cost. Tapping the Total CAPEX KPI card scrolls back to Section 2.

**Formulas:**
```
pvTotalCapacityKW   = solarCapacityKW + pvForBatteryKW
pvSystemCost        = pvTotalCapacityKW × solarPricePerKW   ← ALL panels: daytime + battery charging
totalPVCapex        = pvSystemCost + miscInfraCosts
dailyGenerationKWh  = pvTotalCapacityKW × peakSunHoursPerDay  ← ALL installed panels generate
dailySavings        = dailyGenerationKWh × electricityRate
annualGenerationKWh = totalSolarKW × peakSunHoursPerDay × operatingDaysPerYear
```

> **Annual Savings tooltip:** Annual Savings = Daily Savings × Operating Days/Year (i.e., `dailySavings × operatingWeeksPerYear × operatingDaysPerWeek`). This connects Section 2's per-day output to the Dashboard's annual figure.

#### Section 3 — Battery Storage Results

```

```

**Battery Charge %** shows how much of the battery the allocated solar can fill each day:
- **≥ 100%** — green checkmark, fully charged daily
- **50–99%** — yellow warning, partial charge only
- **< 50%** — red alert, significantly under-allocated

If batteryCapacityKWh is 0, show: **"No battery configured — battery capacity is zero."**

**Formulas:**
```
INPUT FIELDS (Section 3):
batteryCapacityKWh       = User input (default 0, can use requiredBatteryKWh as reference)
pvForBatteryKW           = User input (default 0, can be calculated from battery capacity needs)
batteryPricePerKWh       = User input (suggested: ₱30,000 residential, ₱12,000 commercial)

COMPUTED VALUES:
batteryCost              = batteryCapacityKWh × batteryPricePerKWh
extraSolarCost           = pvForBatteryKW × solarPricePerKW   ← INFORMATIONAL ONLY
                           (shows the battery-dedicated share of pvSystemCost — already included
                            in Section 2 PV Equipment Cost; not added again to totalCapex)
dailyChargeCapacityKWh   = pvForBatteryKW × peakSunHoursPerDay
batteryChargePercent     = IF batteryCapacityKWh > 0 THEN (dailyChargeCapacityKWh / batteryCapacityKWh) × 100 ELSE 0

REFERENCE CALCULATION (for guidance only):
requiredBatteryKWh       = nighttimeLoadKW × nighttimeDurationHours
```

#### Section 4 — Financing Results

When `loanPrincipal > 0`:
```

### 6.4 Spreadsheet Verification (from "250915 SOLAR ROI .xlsx")

The spreadsheet models three scenarios with these results:

| Scenario | CAPEX | Annual Savings | Simple ROI | Payback |
|----------|-------|---------------|------------|---------|
| **A. Solar Only** (300 kW, 4h/day, 300 days) | ₱14,000,000 | ₱3,600,000 | 25.7%/yr | ~3.89 yr |
| **B. Battery Only** (400 kWh LFP, +1h/day) | ₱3,200,000 | ₱900,000 | 28.1%/yr | ~3.56 yr |
| **C. Combined** (Solar + Battery) | ₱17,200,000 | ₱4,500,000 | 26.2%/yr | ~3.82 yr |

Loan example from spreadsheet: ₱14,000,000 principal @ 12% annual over 60 months = ₱311,422.27/month, total payable ₱18,685,336.06, interest ₱4,685,336.06.

## 7. Peak Sun Hours (PSH) Calculator & Reference

### 6.1 Purpose
Help users determine their location's peak sun hours without external research. Accessible as a dedicated reference page (`sunhours.html`) linked from the Peak Sun Hours input field in Section 2.

### 6.2 What is a Peak Sun Hour?

A Peak Sun Hour (PSH) is **not** a literal count of daylight hours. It is a measurement of solar *energy intensity*:

> **1 PSH = 1 hour of sunlight at 1,000 W/m² (Standard Test Condition)**

Example: 500 W/m² for 2 hours in the morning = 1 PSH.

The raw geographic average for the Philippines is **4.5–5.5 hours** depending on region, but **4.0 hours** is the standard conservative baseline used by Philippine solar installers to account for:
- Cloud cover and rainy seasons (Habagat monsoon)
- Panel degradation over time
- Wiring and inverter losses
- Temperature derating

### 6.3 PSH Formula

**Basic formula:**
```
PSH = Total Daily Solar Insolation (Wh/m²) / 1,000 W/m²
```

Since 1,000 Wh = 1 kWh, if a database gives insolation in kWh/m²/day, **PSH equals that number directly**.

**Rigorous definition (integral form):**
```
PSH = ∫(sunrise to sunset) G(t) / G_STC dt

Where:
  G(t)   = actual solar irradiance at time t (W/m²)
  G_STC  = standard reference irradiance (1,000 W/m²)
```

### 6.4 In-App Calculator

The app includes a modal calculator accessible from the Peak Sun Hours field via a "Calculate PSH" button.

#### Input Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Options |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `region` | select | "Metro Manila" | Philippine regions: NCR, CAR, Region I-XII, NIR, BARMM |
| `cityMunicipality` | select | dynamic | Populated based on region selection |
| `roofOrientation` | select | "South" | South, Southeast, Southwest, East, West, North |
| `roofTiltAngle` | select | "Latitude" | Flat (0-10°), Standard (10-20°), Latitude-matched, Steep (30-45°) |
| `latitude` | number | auto | Auto-populated from city; user can override |

#### Base PSH by Region (annual average)

| Region | Base PSH | Approx. Latitude | Cities Reference |
|--------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Metro Manila (NCR) | 4.0 | 14.6° N | Manila, Quezon City, Makati |
| Region I (Ilocos) | 4.5 | 17.6° N | Laoag, Vigan, Dagupan |
| Region II (Cagayan Valley) | 4.3 | 17.5° N | Tuguegarao, Santiago |
| Region III (Central Luzon) | 4.4 | 15.5° N | Angeles, Olongapo, Cabanatuan |
| Region IV-A (Calabarzon) | 4.0 | 14.1° N | Calamba, Batangas City, Lipa |
| Region IV-B (Mimaropa) | 4.2 | 12.0° N | Puerto Princesa, Calapan |
| Region V (Bicol) | 3.9 | 13.4° N | Legazpi, Naga, Iriga |
| Region VI (Western Visayas) | 4.1 | 10.7° N | Iloilo City, Bacolod |
| Region VII (Central Visayas) | 4.2 | 10.3° N | Cebu City, Dumaguete |
| Region VIII (Eastern Visayas) | 4.0 | 11.0° N | Tacloban, Ormoc |
| Region IX (Zamboanga Peninsula) | 4.3 | 7.8° N | Zamboanga City, Dipolog |
| Region X (Northern Mindanao) | 4.1 | 8.5° N | Cagayan de Oro, Iligan |
| Region XI (Davao) | 4.2 | 7.1° N | Davao City, Tagum |
| Region XII (Soccsksargen) | 4.3 | 6.5° N | General Santos, Koronadal |
| Region XIII (Caraga) | 3.9 | 8.9° N | Butuan, Surigao |
| Cordillera (CAR) | 4.0 | 16.4° N | Baguio, Benguet |
| Negros Island Region | 4.1 | 9.6° N | Dumaguete, Bacolod |
| BARMM | 4.4 | 7.0° N | Cotabato City, Marawi |

#### Orientation Adjustment

Because the Philippines is north of the equator (4°–21° N), panels should face **South** for maximum yield.

| Orientation | Adjustment | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| South | +0.0 hrs | Optimal for Northern Hemisphere |
| Southeast | -0.2 hrs | Slight morning bias |
| Southwest | -0.2 hrs | Slight afternoon bias |
| East | -0.4 hrs | Morning sun only |
| West | -0.4 hrs | Afternoon sun only |
| North | -0.6 hrs | Worst case; avoid if possible |

#### Tilt Angle

**Rule of thumb:** Optimal tilt angle ≈ your latitude for year-round production.

```
Optimal Tilt = Latitude ± 5°

For Metro Manila (14.6° N):
  Year-round optimal: 15°
  Dry season (Nov-Apr): Latitude - 15° = ~0° (flatter)
  Wet season (May-Oct): Latitude + 15° = ~30° (steeper, sheds rain)
```

| Tilt Category | Angle Range | PSH Adjustment | Best For |
|---------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| Flat | 0–10° | -0.1 hrs | Flat roofs, easier install |
| Standard | 10–20° | +0.0 hrs | Most Philippine roofs |
| Latitude-matched | Latitude ± 5° | +0.1 hrs | Optimal year-round |
| Steep | 30–45° | -0.2 hrs | Rain shedding, typhoon areas |

#### Calculated Output

```
Estimated PSH = Base PSH (from region)
              + Orientation Adjustment
              + Tilt Adjustment

Example: Cebu City, South-facing, Latitude-matched tilt
  = 4.2 + 0.0 + 0.1
  = 4.3 PSH
```

Modal shows a "Use this value" button that populates the Section 2 `peakSunHoursPerDay` field.

### 6.5 Dedicated Reference Page (`sunhours.html`)

A separate static page linked from the PSH tooltip and modal, containing:

1. **What is PSH** — full explanation with the bell-curve concept
2. **Basic & rigorous formulas** — simplified and integral forms
3. **Extraterrestrial Radiation formula** (latitude-based theoretical maximum):
   ```
   H₀ = (24 × 60 / π) × G_sc × d_r × (ω_s × sin(φ) × sin(δ) + cos(φ) × cos(δ) × sin(ω_s))

   Where:
     φ      = Latitude (radians)
     G_sc   = Solar constant (1,367 W/m²)
     d_r    = Inverse relative Earth-Sun distance (varies by day of year)
     δ      = Solar declination (Earth's tilt, varies by day)
     ω_s    = Sunset hour angle = arccos(-tan(φ) × tan(δ))
   ```
   Note: For Philippines (~13–15° N), this gives 9–10 theoretical PSH — actual ground-level is 4–5 PSH due to atmosphere and weather.

4. **Hargreaves-Samani practical model** (latitude + temperature):
   ```
   R_s = k_Rs × √(T_max - T_min) × H₀

   Where:
     R_s    = Actual solar radiation (ground-level PSH)
     H₀     = Extraterrestrial radiation (from latitude formula)
     T_max  = Daily maximum temperature
     T_min  = Daily minimum temperature
     k_Rs   = 0.16 (inland) or 0.19 (coastal Philippines)
   ```

5. **Why satellite data beats formulas** — Habagat/Amihan seasonal variation, 20-year satellite averages

6. **Optimal tilt angle formula:**
   ```
   Year-round: Tilt ≈ Latitude
   Summer optimization: Tilt = Latitude - 15°
   Winter optimization: Tilt = Latitude + 15°
   ```
   All panels in the Philippines should face **South** (toward the equator from the Northern Hemisphere).

7. **External PSH data sources** (with instructions):

| Source | URL | How to Use |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| **Global Solar Atlas** (World Bank) | globalsolaratlas.info | Search location → read GHI (kWh/m²/day) = PSH |
| **NREL PVWatts Calculator** | pvwatts.nrel.gov | Enter address → "Solar Radiation (kWh/m²/day)" month-by-month |
| **Solargis Philippines** | solargis.com/maps-and-gis-data/download/philippines | High-res solar radiation maps |

### 6.6 Peak Sun Hours Tooltip (in Section 2)

The tooltip on the `peakSunHoursPerDay` field displays:

```
Peak Sun Hours (PSH) = equivalent hours of full sun (1,000 W/m²) per day.
Philippine average: 4.0–4.5 hours/day (conservative baseline).
Raw geographic potential: 4.5–5.5 hours/day.

Using 4.0 hrs accounts for clouds, rain, panel losses, and degradation.

## 10. UI Requirements

### 9.1 Layout

#### Default Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile (< 768px):** Single column, collapsible accordion sections, sticky bottom KPI sheet
- **Tablet (768–1023px):** Single column, wider inputs, KPI below form
- **Desktop (≥ 1024px):** Two-column — inputs (60%) left, KPI dashboard sticky sidebar (40%) right

#### Manual Layout Toggle
Users can override the default layout with a toggle in the header:

| Toggle State | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| **Phone** 📱 | Forces single-column vertical layout regardless of screen width |
| **Desktop** 🖥️ | Forces two-column sidebar layout (if screen permits) or maximized single column |
| **Auto** (default) | Follows responsive breakpoints above |

**Implementation:** The layout toggle sets a `data-layout` attribute on the body/container:
```html
<body data-layout="auto">  <!-- auto | phone | desktop -->
```

CSS responds to this attribute:
```css
/* Phone mode - always stacked */
[data-layout="phone"] .kpi-sidebar { position: relative; }

/* Desktop mode - side by side */
[data-layout="desktop"] .kpi-sidebar { position: sticky; }
```

### 9.2 Results Dashboard

The Results Dashboard is the main summary view. Each KPI references back to the section it derives from, so users can trace any number back to its source inputs.

| # | KPI | Format | Source Section | Color Coding |
|---|-----|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Projected Annual Cost | ₱ #,###,### /yr | Section 1: Status Quo | Red (current cost baseline) |
| 2 | Projected Monthly Cost | ₱ #,###,### /mo | Section 1: Status Quo | Red (current cost baseline) |
| 3 | Total CAPEX | ₱ #,###,### | Section 2 + 3: PV + Battery | — |
| 4 | Annual Generation | #,### kWh/yr | Section 2: PV System | — |
| 5 | Annual Savings | ₱ #,###,### /yr | Section 1 rate × Section 2 generation | Green if > 0 |
| 6 | Simple ROI | ##.#% /yr | CAPEX vs Savings | Green ≥ 15%, Yellow 8–14.9%, Red < 8% |
| 7 | Payback Period | #.# years | CAPEX vs Savings | Green ≤ 5, Yellow 5.1–8, Red > 8 |
| 8 | Monthly Savings | ₱ #,###,### /mo | Annual Savings ÷ 12 | — |
| 9 | Monthly Amortization | ₱ #,###,### /mo | Section 4: Financing | Show only if loan > 0 |
| 10 | Net Monthly Cash Flow | ₱ #,###,### /mo | Savings − Amortization | Green if +, Red if −. Show only if loan > 0 |
| 11 | Total Interest Paid | ₱ #,###,### | Section 4: Financing | Show only if loan > 0 |

**Dashboard-to-Section Navigation:** Each KPI card is tappable/clickable. Tapping a KPI scrolls to and briefly highlights the source section, so users can adjust the relevant inputs directly.

### 9.3 Design System

#### Light Theme (Default)
- **Primary color:** `#0f766e` (teal-700)
- **Background:** `#f9fafb` (gray-50)
- **Card background:** `#ffffff`
- **Text primary:** `#111827` (gray-900)
- **Text secondary:** `#6b7280` (gray-500)
- **Border:** `#e5e7eb` (gray-200)

#### Dark Theme (Night Mode) — High Contrast
- **Primary color:** `#14b8a6` (teal-500)
- **Background:** `#0f172a` (slate-900)
- **Card background:** `#1e293b` (slate-800)
- **Text primary:** `#f8fafc` (slate-50) — brightest for headings
- **Text secondary/labels:** `#e2e8f0` (slate-200) — high contrast for labels
- **Text muted:** `#94a3b8` (slate-400) — for less important text
- **Border:** `#475569` (slate-600) — visible but not harsh

**Accessibility Requirement:** All text in dark mode must meet WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum). Labels and input text use `#e2e8f0` on `#1e293b` background (contrast ratio ~11:1).

#### Common
- **Font:** Inter via Google Fonts, fallback system-ui
- **KPI values:** 28px bold (desktop), 22px (mobile)
- **Border radius:** `rounded-xl` cards, `rounded-lg` inputs

### 9.4 Theme Toggle

Location: Header bar, right side

```
☀️ / 🌙  [Toggle Switch]
```

**Behavior:**
- Click toggles between light and dark themes
- Icon changes: ☀️ for light mode, 🌙 for dark mode
- Preference saved to `localStorage`
- On load, checks:
  1. Saved preference in `localStorage`
  2. System preference via `prefers-color-scheme`
  3. Defaults to light mode

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Apply theme by setting class on html element
html.classList.toggle('dark', isDarkMode);
```

```css
/* Tailwind dark mode classes */
.dark .card { @apply bg-slate-800 border-slate-700; }
```

---

## 11. Accessibility Requirements

- All inputs have associated `<label>` elements
- Tooltips use `role="tooltip"` and `aria-describedby`
- KPI color coding supplemented with text labels
- Modal uses `<dialog>` with focus trapping
- Minimum touch target: 44×44px
- Keyboard navigation through all inputs
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Theme respects `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Layout toggle has clear visual state

---

## 12. Milestone Execution Rules

These rules exist to prevent past breakages from recurring. **Every milestone must follow them without exception.**

---

### Rule 1 — `calc.js` ↔ `state.js` Field Parity (Critical)

> **Every field returned by `calculateAll()` in `calc.js` must also exist in `defaultResults` in `state.js`.**

**Why this matters:** On startup, `updateAllKPIs()` runs against the hardcoded `defaultResults` before any user input fires a recalculation. If a field is missing from `defaultResults`, it is `undefined`. Calling `.toFixed()`, `.toLocaleString()`, or any number method on `undefined` throws an uncaught `TypeError` that crashes the entire update chain — **no results will ever update**, not just the one missing field.

**When adding a new computed field:**
1. Add it to the `return` object in `calculateAll()` in `calc.js`
2. Add it to `defaultResults` in `state.js` with the correct value computed from the home defaults
3. Add a test for it in `tests/calc.test.js`
4. Handle it in the relevant `updateSectionXResults()` function in `ui.js`

**Verification:** After adding any new field, reload the app from scratch with no saved state and confirm no console errors appear.

---

### Rule 2 — Defensive Rendering in `ui.js`

> **All `updateSectionXResults()` functions must guard against `undefined` / `null` before calling number methods.**

Pattern:
```javascript
// WRONG — crashes if field is undefined
el.textContent = results.someField.toFixed(1) + ' kW';

// CORRECT — safe fallback
el.textContent = (results.someField ?? 0).toFixed(1) + ' kW';
// or for conditional display:
el.textContent = results.someField != null
  ? results.someField.toFixed(1) + ' kW'
  : '—';
```

This prevents a single missing field from crashing the whole update chain.

---

### Rule 3 — New Input Fields Require Full Registration

> **Every new input field added to `index.html` must be registered in all four locations:**

| File | Location | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| `js/state.js` | `defaultInputs` | Add with home default value |
| `js/state.js` | `defaultResults` (if it also appears in results) | Add with computed default |
| `js/ui.js` | `bindInputHandlers()` input ID list | Add field ID |
| `js/ui.js` | `updateAllInputs()` input ID list | Add field ID |
| `js/ui.js` | `getInputValues()` input ID list | Add field ID |

Missing any of these causes silent failures: the field either doesn't trigger recalculation, doesn't restore from saved state, or doesn't sync when presets load.

---

### Rule 4 — No Console Errors on Load

> **After completing any milestone phase, reload the app (no saved state) and confirm zero red errors in the browser console.**

This is the single fastest way to catch Rule 1 and Rule 2 violations before they compound.

---

## 13. Milestones & Deliverables

Development is organized into 7 milestones. Each milestone produces a reviewable, testable deliverable. **You should review and test at the end of each milestone before proceeding.**

---

### Milestone 1: Calculation Engine (MVP Foundation)
> **Goal:** All math works correctly with no UI. Verifiable via command line.

| Phase | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1.1 | `calc.js` — pure calculation functions | All formulas from Section 5.2 implemented |
| 1.2 | `tests/calc.test.js` — unit tests | `node tests/calc.test.js` passes all assertions |
| 1.3 | `format.js` — currency/number formatting | `formatCurrency(146000)` → `"₱146,000.00"` |
| 1.4 | `state.js` — reactive state with Proxy | Changing any field triggers registered callback |

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] `node tests/calc.test.js` — all pass
- [ ] Basic payback: 10kW, ₱10/kWh, 4 PSH, 365 days → CAPEX ₱300,000, Payback ~2.05yr
- [ ] Amortization: ₱14M, 12%, 60mo → ₱311,422.27/mo
- [ ] Division-by-zero guards work (0 savings → Infinity payback)
- [ ] Projected monthly cost = annual cost / 12
- [ ] **Field parity (Rule 1):** Every field in `calculateAll()` return object also exists in `defaultResults` — confirm by cross-checking both lists
- [ ] No console errors on fresh load (open app with no saved state)

---

### Milestone 2: Core UI + Section Forms (MVP Usable)
> **Goal:** All 4 sections render with inputs. Each section shows its own inline results panel. Results Dashboard aggregates all KPIs. Real-time recalculation on every input change.

| Phase | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 2.1 | `index.html` shell + Tailwind CDN + `manifest.json` | Opens in browser with header and empty sections |
| 2.2 | Section 1 — Status Quo form + **Section 1 Results** | Rate, schedule, daily consumption inputs; inline annual + monthly cost |
| 2.3 | Section 2 — PhotoVoltaic System form + **Section 2 Results** | PV inputs; inline PV cost, daily/annual generation |
| 2.4 | Section 3 — Battery Storage form + **Section 3 Results** | Battery inputs; inline battery kWh, cost, extra PV needed |
| 2.5 | Section 4 — Financing form + **Section 4 Results** | Loan inputs; inline amortization, total cost, interest |
| 2.6 | Results Dashboard with section references | All 11 KPIs display; tapping KPI scrolls to source section |
| 2.7 | State persistence + Reset to Defaults | Inputs auto-save to `localStorage`; "Reset to Defaults" button restores all inputs to PRD defaults |

> **Important — Hard Refresh Behavior:** A browser hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`) clears cached files (HTML, CSS, JS) but does **not** clear `localStorage`. This means previously entered values will still load after a hard refresh. This is by design — users should not lose their work on refresh.
>
> To load the default values, the user must click **"Reset to Defaults"**. Clearing `localStorage` manually (DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Clear) also resets to defaults.

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] All 18 input fields render with correct labels, defaults, and units
- [ ] Each section shows its own results panel that updates in real time
- [ ] Results Dashboard shows all 11 KPIs
- [ ] Tapping a KPI card scrolls to the source section
- [ ] Projected Annual Cost AND Monthly Cost display in Section 1 results
- [ ] Annual Bill override updates both annual and monthly projections
- [ ] Battery section shows "No battery needed" when batteryCapacityKWh = 0
- [ ] Financing section shows "Cash purchase" when loan = 0
- [ ] **"Reset to Defaults" button** restores all inputs to PRD default values and clears `localStorage`
- [ ] After reset, all KPIs reflect the home default scenario (₱20/kWh, 1 kW, 5 kWh battery)
- [ ] Hard refresh preserves previously entered values (does not reset)
- [ ] **No console errors** on fresh load (open app with no saved state, all inputs at defaults)

---

### Milestone 3: Tooltips, Onboarding & Sun Hours
> **Goal:** Contextual help system complete. New users can self-onboard. Sun hours calculator eliminates guesswork.

| Phase | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 3.1 | Tooltip system | Click ❓ → tooltip appears with help text; click away closes |
| 3.2 | Onboarding modal (4 slides) | "Guide" button opens modal; ESC/click-outside closes; focuses first input on dismiss |
| 3.3 | Sun hours calculator modal | Region/city dropdown → outputs peak sun hours; "Use this value" populates Section 2 |
| 3.4 | External reference links in tooltips | Peak sun hours tooltip includes NREL, PVWatts links |

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] All 16 fields have working tooltips with correct copy
- [ ] Only one tooltip open at a time
- [ ] Onboarding modal shows on first visit (sessionStorage flag)
- [ ] All 4 onboarding slides display correctly
- [ ] Sun hours calculator returns reasonable values for all regions
- [ ] Sun hours "Use this value" populates the input and closes modal
- [ ] External links open in new tab
- [ ] No console errors on fresh load

---

### Milestone 4: PWA, Themes & Layout
> **Goal:** App is installable, works offline, and supports night/day mode and layout preferences.

| Phase | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 4.1 | `sw.js` — service worker + offline caching | App loads after going offline |
| 4.2 | Night/Day theme toggle | Toggle switches themes; preference persists in localStorage; respects system preference |
| 4.3 | Phone/Desktop layout toggle | 3-state toggle (Auto/Phone/Desktop) in header; layout changes immediately |
| 4.4 | `themes.css` — light and dark theme variables | All colors, borders, backgrounds adapt to theme |

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] PWA installs on Android Chrome ("Add to Home Screen")
- [ ] PWA installs on iOS Safari
- [ ] App works fully offline after first load
- [ ] Theme toggle switches between light/dark
- [ ] Theme persists across page reloads
- [ ] System `prefers-color-scheme` detected on first load
- [ ] Layout toggle works at all screen widths
- [ ] Desktop mode on small screen shows maximized single column
- [ ] No console errors on fresh load

---

### Milestone 5: Polish & Accessibility (Release Candidate)
> **Goal:** Production-ready. Passes Lighthouse audits. All edge cases handled.

| Phase | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 5.1 | Responsive polish | Visual check at 375px (iPhone SE), 768px (iPad), 1024px+ |
| 5.2 | KPI conditional coloring | ROI/Payback/CashFlow colors match spec thresholds |
| 5.3 | Edge case handling | All scenarios from Section 14 handled gracefully |
| 5.4 | Accessibility audit | Tab order, labels, ARIA roles, focus trapping, touch targets |

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Lighthouse PWA audit ≥ 90
- [ ] Lighthouse Accessibility audit ≥ 90
- [ ] KPI colors: ROI Green ≥ 15%, Yellow 8–14.9%, Red < 8%
- [ ] KPI colors: Payback Green ≤ 5yr, Yellow 5.1–8yr, Red > 8yr
- [ ] "Did you mean 12%?" hint when rate < 1
- [ ] "Loan exceeds system cost" warning when loan > CAPEX
- [ ] Keyboard navigation through all inputs in section order
- [ ] No console errors on fresh load
- [ ] No console errors on any interaction path
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` disables transitions

---

### Milestone 6: Narrative Summary (Story Mode)
> **Goal:** All computed data is woven into a plain-language narrative that tells the user's solar ROI story from problem to verdict. Readable, shareable, and updates in real time.

| Phase | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 6.1 | Narrative data assembly | A `generateNarrative(inputs, results)` function in `calc.js` or new `narrative.js` returns structured text blocks from all computed fields |
| 6.2 | Narrative UI panel | Scrollable text panel below Dashboard (or toggle "Show Narrative"); all values formatted with `formatPeso()`, `formatPercent()`, `formatYears()` |
| 6.3 | Conditional sections | Battery section hidden when no battery; Financing section hidden when cash purchase; Verdict tone matches ROI color |
| 6.4 | Section back-references | Tapping a section name in the narrative scrolls to the source input section |
| 6.5 | Copy to Clipboard | "Copy" button copies full narrative as formatted plain text to clipboard |
| 6.6 | Export as .txt file | "Export" button triggers a browser file download of the narrative as a `.txt` file, named `solarcalc-report-{date}.txt` |
| 6.7 | Real-time updates | Narrative re-renders on every input change via the same reactive state pipeline |

**Export file format (`solarcalc-report-YYYY-MM-DD.txt`):**
```

```

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Narrative displays all 7 parts (Problem, Hypothesis, Battery, CAPEX, Return, Financing, Verdict)
- [ ] Battery paragraph hidden when batteryCapacityKWh = 0
- [ ] Financing paragraph hidden when loanPrincipal = 0
- [ ] Verdict is 🔴 Red when `paybackYears > 6` OR (`hasFinancing` AND `netMonthlyCashFlow < 0`)
- [ ] Verdict is 🟡 Yellow when `paybackYears > 4` OR (`hasFinancing` AND `netMonthlyCashFlow < 20% of monthlySavings`)
- [ ] Verdict is 🟢 Green when `paybackYears ≤ 4` AND (no financing OR `netMonthlyCashFlow ≥ 20% of monthlySavings`)
- [ ] Cash flow buffer conditions only evaluated when `loanPrincipal > 0`
- [ ] Verdict text matches the specific trigger (slow payback vs. thin/negative cash flow — different messages)
- [ ] `cashFlowBufferPct` and `loanShareOfSavingsPct` computed and inserted into verdict text where applicable
- [ ] All peso values formatted correctly (₱ with commas)
- [ ] Narrative updates instantly when any input changes
- [ ] "Copy to Clipboard" copies clean plain text (no HTML tags)
- [ ] No console errors on fresh load
- [ ] "Export as .txt" triggers a file download named `solarcalc-report-YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- [ ] Exported file opens correctly in any text editor
- [ ] Section names in narrative are tappable and scroll to source section
- [ ] Narrative reads coherently for: residential no-battery, commercial with battery, financed vs cash

---

### Milestone 7: Save Specifications
> **Goal:** Users can save the current set of inputs as a named specification, load it back later, and export/import specs as JSON files — enabling scenario comparison, client handoffs, and cross-device use.

#### What is a Specification?

A **specification** (or "spec") is a named snapshot of all current input values. Unlike the auto-save that `localStorage` performs continuously, specifications are **intentionally saved** by the user and persist independently. Multiple specs can be stored at once — a user might have "Home 5kW No Battery", "Home 5kW With Battery", and "Office 100kW" all saved and switchable.

#### 7.0 — Spec Selector in the Header (Top of Page)

The primary entry point for all spec operations is a **Spec Selector** at the very top of the page — always visible, above all sections. It has three controls in a single row:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [▼ Home 5kW With Battery      ]  [Save]  [Save As...]  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Dropdown (left)** — shows the currently active spec name (or "Unsaved" if no spec is loaded). Clicking opens a list of all saved specs. Selecting one loads it immediately.
- **Save (middle)** — overwrites the currently active spec with the current inputs. Disabled / shows "Unsaved" if no spec is active yet.
- **Save As… (right)** — prompts for a name and saves as a new spec. Becomes the active spec.

**Dropdown list appearance:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ● Home 5kW With Battery   (active)           │
│    Home 5kW No Battery                        │
│    Office 100kW Commercial                    │
│  ──────────────────────────────────────────── │
│  + New (unsaved)                              │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- The active spec is marked with a filled circle (●)
- Selecting "New (unsaved)" clears the active spec label to "Unsaved" but does NOT reset inputs — the user continues editing
- Scrollable if more than 5 specs are saved

#### Spec Data Structure

```json
{
  "id": "spec_1710000000000",
  "name": "Home 5kW With Battery",
  "savedAt": "2026-03-16T10:30:00.000Z",
  "inputs": {
    "electricityRate": 20,
    "operatingWeeksPerYear": 52,
    "operatingDaysPerWeek": 7,
    "dailyEnergyConsumptionKWh": 10,
    "solarCapacityKW": 5,
    "peakSunHoursPerDay": 4,
    "solarPricePerKW": 60000,
    "miscInfraCosts": 30000,
    "batteryPricePerKWh": 30000,
    "batteryCapacityKWh": 12,
    "pvForBatteryKW": 3,
    "nighttimeLoadKW": 1,
    "nighttimeDurationHours": 10,
    "loanPrincipal": 0,
    "annualInterestRate": 0,
    "loanTermMonths": 60
  }
}
```

Specs are stored in `localStorage` under key `solarCalcSpecs` as a JSON array. Maximum of **20 saved specs** per device.

| Phase | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 7.0 | Spec Selector in header | Dropdown + Save + Save As… always visible at top of page |
| 7.1 | Save As… | Prompts for name; saves to `localStorage`; becomes active spec in dropdown |
| 7.2 | Save (overwrite) | Overwrites current active spec with current inputs; updates `savedAt` timestamp |
| 7.3 | Load via dropdown | Selecting a spec from dropdown loads all its inputs and triggers full recalculation |
| 7.4 | Delete Spec | Manage panel: each spec has a delete (×) button; confirmation before delete |
| 7.5 | Rename Spec | Manage panel: inline edit of spec name |
| 7.6 | Export specs as JSON | "Export All" downloads all saved specs as `solarcalc-specs-YYYY-MM-DD.json` |
| 7.7 | Import specs from JSON | "Import" accepts a `.json` file; merges with existing (skips duplicates by name) |

**Manage Specs panel** (accessible from dropdown or a gear icon):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SAVED SPECIFICATIONS                   [×] │
│                                             │
│  🏠 Home 5kW With Battery     [Edit] [Del]  │
│     5 kW + 12 kWh • ₱20/kWh                │
│     CAPEX ₱600,000 • Payback 4.8 yr        │
│     Saved: Mar 16, 2026 10:30am            │
│                                             │
│  🏢 Office 100kW Commercial   [Edit] [Del]  │
│     100 kW • ₱15/kWh                       │

│  [Export All as JSON]  [Import from JSON]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Review checklist:**

## Changelog

### v1.7.0 (2026-03-16) — PV Equipment Cost Formula & Preset Completeness
- **Fixed:** `pvSystemCost` formula now uses `(solarCapacityKW + pvForBatteryKW) × solarPricePerKW` — all PV panels (daytime + battery-charging) are one purchase, priced together
- **Fixed:** `totalCapex` = `totalPVCapex + batteryCost` only — `extraSolarCost` is no longer double-counted (it's informational breakdown shown in Section 3)
- **Fixed:** Spreadsheet preset `dailyEnergyConsumptionKWh` corrected from 818 to 1,200 (= 300 kW × 4 PSH)
- **Updated:** Battery Only preset table now lists all 15 parameters with rationale
- **Updated:** Spreadsheet preset table now lists all 15 parameters including loan term
- **Added:** Note on `extraSolarCost` — informational only, not added to `totalCapex`

### v1.6.0 (2026-03-16) — Milestone Execution Rules
- **Added:** Section 12 "Milestone Execution Rules" — 4 standing development rules to prevent regressions
  - Rule 1: `calc.js` ↔ `state.js` field parity — every `calculateAll()` return field must exist in `defaultResults`
  - Rule 2: Defensive rendering in `ui.js` — guard against `undefined`/`null` before calling number methods
  - Rule 3: New input field registration checklist — 5 locations must be updated in sync
  - Rule 4: No console errors on fresh load — mandatory gate for every milestone
- **Added:** "Field parity" and "no console errors" checks to every milestone review checklist
- **Renumbered:** Old Section 12 (Milestones) → 13; Edge Cases → 14; Testing → 15

### v1.5.0 (2026-03-16)
- **Added:** Milestone 7 "Save Specifications" — named save/load/export/import of input configurations
- **Added:** Spec data structure (`id`, `name`, `savedAt`, `inputs`) stored in `localStorage` key `solarCalcSpecs`
- **Added:** Saved Specs panel with card view (name, date, system size, CAPEX, payback)
- **Added:** Export specs as `solarcalc-specs-YYYY-MM-DD.json`; import from `.json` file
- **Added:** Max 20 specs per device limit
- **Updated:** Milestone count from 6 to 7
- **Clarified:** Hard refresh behavior — `localStorage` is not cleared on hard refresh; "Reset to Defaults" button is the correct way to restore defaults

### v1.4.0 (2026-03-16) — Battery Section Restructure
- **Major Restructure:** Battery Storage section (Section 3) reorganized with new input fields
  - **Moved:** `batteryPricePerKWh` from Section 2 to Section 3 (now a battery-specific input)
  - **Added:** `batteryCapacityKWh` input field — user-defined battery size (not auto-calculated from load)
  - **Added:** `pvForBatteryKW` input field — dedicated PV capacity for battery charging
  - **Added:** `dailyChargeCapacityKWh` computed field — shows how much the allocated PV can charge per day
  - **Updated:** `batteryChargePercent` formula now uses user inputs: `(pvForBatteryKW × peakSunHours) / batteryCapacityKWh × 100`
  - **Updated:** `batteryCost` formula now uses user input: `batteryCapacityKWh × batteryPricePerKWh`
  - **Updated:** `extraSolarCost` formula: `pvForBatteryKW × solarPricePerKW` (replaces calculated extraSolarForBatteryKW)
  - **Reference only:** Nighttime kWh/Hr and Nighttime Duration now provide guidance for battery sizing but don't auto-populate Battery Capacity
- **Updated:** Section 2 Results now shows **PV Total Capacity** (`solarCapacityKW + pvForBatteryKW`) as first line
- **Updated:** Pricing philosophy — Solar Price/kW and Battery Price/kWh are now **editable defaults** (suggestions, not locked values)
- **Updated:** Residential preset defaults — 5 kWh/day consumption, 7 days/week operation, 12 kWh battery, 3 kW PV for battery, ₱15/kWh electricity rate (uses app default)
- **Updated:** Commercial preset defaults — 100 kWh/day consumption (100 employees × 1 kWh/person), 5 days/week operation, 180 kWh battery, 45 kW PV for battery, ₱15/kWh electricity rate (uses app default)
- **Removed:** Preset-specific electricity rates (₱20/kWh residential, ₱15/kWh commercial) — both now use the app default ₱15/kWh with guidance for users to adjust based on actual bills
- **Updated:** Input field count from 16 to 18 (added batteryCapacityKWh and pvForBatteryKW)
- **Updated:** Narrative (Story Mode) Part 3 to reflect new battery input structure
- **Updated:** All preset tables to include new battery fields with calculated examples
- **Updated:** PRD version to 1.4.0

### v1.3.0 (2026-03-16)
- **Added:** Section 5 "Section-by-Section Explanation" — detailed walkthrough of all 4 input sections with user stories, formulas, and examples
- **Added:** `annualConsumptionKWh` computed field — daily kWh × operating days/year (consumption chain)
- **Added:** `dailySavings` computed field — daily generation × electricity rate (savings chain in Section 2)
- **Added:** PV System → CAPEX linkage: Total CAPEX = PV System (Section 2) + Battery Storage (Section 3)
- **Added:** Annual Savings tooltip explanation: dailySavings × operatingDaysPerYear
- **Added:** Simple ROI and Payback clarity: ROI = Annual Savings ÷ CAPEX; Payback = inverse of ROI
- **Added:** Monthly Savings note: Annual Savings ÷ 12
- **Added:** Electricity rate benchmarks table (Residential ₱11–13, Commercial ₱9–11, Industrial ₱7–9)
- **Expanded:** Section 7 PSH Calculator into comprehensive reference (formulas, theory, data sources)
- **Added:** `sunhours.html` standalone reference page with PSH explanation, latitude formulas, tilt angle guidance, regional data, and external data source links
- **Added:** Section 5.5 "The Narrative" — 7-part plain-language story mode (Problem → Hypothesis → Evidence → Verdict)
- **Added:** Milestone 6 "Narrative Summary (Story Mode)" with review checklist
- **Added:** Battery solar allocation % — shows what percentage of battery can be charged by allocated solar
- **Updated:** Development milestones from 5 to 6
- **Updated:** PRD version to 1.3.0

### v1.2.0 (2026-03-16)
- **Renamed:** "Solar System" → "PhotoVoltaic System" throughout all documents
- **Added:** Per-section inline results panels (each section shows its own computed outputs)
- **Added:** Projected Monthly Cost (`projectedAnnualCost / 12`) alongside annual cost
- **Added:** Results Dashboard KPI-to-section navigation (tap KPI → scroll to source section)
- **Added:** Intermediate computed fields: `pvSystemCost`, `totalPVCapex`, `dailyGenerationKWh`, `batteryCost`
- **Updated:** Results Dashboard expanded from 9 to 11 KPIs with source section references
- **Updated:** Computed fields table now includes Section column for traceability

### v1.1.0 (2026-03-16)
- **Added:** Projected Annual Cost calculation in Status Quo section
- **Added:** Daily Energy Consumption input field
- **Added:** Sun Hours Per Day Calculator with Philippine region data
- **Added:** Peak sun hours tooltip with external reference links (Google Project Sunroof, NREL)
- **Added:** Night/Day theme toggle with system preference detection
- **Added:** Phone/Desktop layout toggle for manual layout control
- **Moved:** Dark mode from "Out of Scope" to "In Scope"
- **Updated:** File structure to include `themes.js`, `layout.js`, `sunhours.js`, and `philippine-sun-hours.json`
- **Updated:** KPI Dashboard to include Projected Annual Cost
- **Updated:** Implementation phases to include new features
